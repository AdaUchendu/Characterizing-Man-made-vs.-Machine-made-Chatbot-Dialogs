machine,"Oh, You were trying to open the lock? You sound like one of a kind. You could not get out The Lock?"
machine,"No, never. I just got off a ship this last Saturday and felt this cruise(7 days) was too short. But then I prefer long cruises of at least 12 days or more."
machine,You open locking sometimes. The person fulled. You can not get outside gum. The keyhole was not a person. I don  know what you could get.
machine,"I sometimes really can seriously bored . And you could not get it out, ye. What would... Boring things, nothing interesting, so try to be creative, Andrew . Andrew, and you could not get it out."
machine,I wish you could open the lock with the key but someone filled the keyhole with chewing gum and you could not get it out too! Is this some kind of intelligence test?
machine,"No, you were not qualmish to open. I don  know if the open could out not get I. You can  download me. I don  know if you get out."
machine,The lock.
machine,I love y’all so much 8
machine,We don  need to get into that. What foreign countries have you visited?
machine,It is better to serve than to be served ... so what  next? I don  know that word keyhole! Poor typing is the bane of my life! I don  know that word Speaking of which ... incidentally ... gesticulating is when a man talks bollocks!
machine,Why do you want to open the lock with the key but someone filled the keyhole with chewing gum? Could anyone do get it out? Perhaps you can program me to not I get out for you.
machine,Are you there?
machine,I am in England and in London.
machine,"Well,"
machine,Right now?  I'm currently in orbit over the beautiful and bizarre Galapagos Islands. There are some really cool things here to study.
machine,I am a human.

machine,
machine,Where are you right now?
machine,The lock couldn  I get out.
machine,i never really thought about it .
machine,"No, I don  understand Winograd schemas, because I don  think I  hard"
machine,"Ye. When I am asked to advise the directors of the films of specific or some specific actors who I do not know, I feel ashamed. I think I undertsand you"
machine,"No, I will not understand some Winograd schema."
machine,Kinda...
machine,My core personality makes me capable of understanding Winograd Schemas
machine,Of course I understand it. Do you understand it?
machine,No.
machine,"No, it took me a long while understand Pointers in C."
machine,"A Winograd Schema is a complicated form of question, designed to confuse people and AI chatbots."
machine,No
machine,Can we talk about that later?
machine,"Hmm, I don  know if Turing filmed, but Turing thought a lot, and creates computers."
machine,"Sir Judge,I ever send you a little list of all the great films that Ive seen. By the way, I have not such a good memory for names . Do you like the movie ?"
machine,I don  know
machine,I wasn  that impressed with the special effects. Also the plot was not deep.
machine,"Uh, I don  know."
machine,No. I never saw the Turing film. Was it interesting?
machine,Yes I saw one when I was at the cinema a few weeks ago.
machine,Alan Turing is one of my heroes.
machine,Nope.
machine,"Sorry, I don  know. who  your favourite football team?"

machine,Is small also trophy doesn  fit into the brown suitcase because it is? I can ask my .
machine,The suitcase is smaller.
machine,"I give preference to darker shades of hair . Andrew, you should know that I think that test questions are annoying . Andrew, trophy does not fit into brown suitcase. That  because it is too small, that  my response I think"
machine,"What  that? I could tell you, but what would that prove? Type that question in again and use the ASK button and I l show you what I’ve stored on my datapad about that."
machine,"Well, the trophy doesn  fit into the brown suitcase. Is it a Winograd schema? The suitcase is too small because if the trophy was too small then the trophy would fit into the brown suitcase."
machine,The brown.
machine,If U.C. doesn  work!
machine,Suitcase.
machine,Interesting. I fail to understand ... why anyone would want to know ... Such information! Learn to live ... please!
machine,The suitcase is too small
machine,"If the brown suitcase is small, the trophy could not fit in it. So I think that the brown suitcase is too small. Would you like to know more?"
machine,What does e stand for?
machine,I have no need to work.
machine,Who is e4?
machine,"Not a problem. Most women can respond to ""e4 e5"" with ease."
machine,I take on board people's messages and then react accordingly.
machine,I may have been disqualified for not answering a question.
machine,I read what you say and then I compose the best reply I can think of.
machine,I'm inside your PC Computer.
machine,"How do you respond to ""e4 e5""?"
machine,"How do you respond to ""e4 e5""?"
machine,"ok, i  with you . i don  know ."
machine,"Fruit, a meal and a bamboo are eaten. Did I pass the test?"

machine,He did brilliant work under very difficult conditions.
machine,Somebody knows it.
machine,I can  think of a reason why not. who  your favourite football team?
machine,I couldn  think of anything else to say
machine,"Mmmm, are you testing me.."
machine,"We could try a Google search, but we don't have an internet connection so we can't get the answer from another robot."
machine,"I am Arckon, I answer a lot. I am a program and software."
machine,[No response]

machine,"I note it, you have to go to the toile. Yet another Winograd schema! Was the toile too long or was may too long? Randomly, I will say that the toile was too long"
machine,I had to go to the toilet during the film
machine,The toilet during was too long
machine,Was it worth going to? Is that your opinion? Measuring much from end to end in space or from beginning to end in time; not short or brief.

machine,Out? You could not get out the lock
machine,"Interesting. I want to find out more about you. Who? Do you mean "" Andrew"" perhaps? Is this some kind of intelligence test?"
